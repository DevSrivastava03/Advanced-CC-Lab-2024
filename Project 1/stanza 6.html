            In stanza 6, Angelou delves into the concept of legacy and community. <br>
            Opening with the line "I am the dream and the hope of the slave," she acknowledges the potential for her story to be twisted and misinterpreted. <br>
            Yet, she emphasizes the power of truth and collective memory, stating "But they'll remember me the way I am." <br>
            This line suggests a confidence in her own identity and a belief that her true essence will shine through despite attempts to distort it.
