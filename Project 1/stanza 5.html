The fifth stanza of "Still I Rise" focuses on the speaker's inner wealth and resilience.<br> 
"I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide," she declares, drawing an image of vastness and power.<br>
 The oil wells "pumping in my living room" and gold mines "diggin' in my own backyard" signify self-sufficiency and hidden riches beyond what the oppressor can see. <br>
 This metaphor emphasizes that her true value lies not in external validation but within her own potential and self-worth.<br>
  "You may write me down in history / With your bitter, twisted lies," she reiterates, acknowledging attempts to diminish her,<br>
   but ultimately declares, "But still, like dust, I'll rise." The stanza portrays the speaker as boundless and self-sustaining, <br>
   her spirit unshakeable by external negativity. It's a powerful claim of self-worth and a rejection of external definitions of value.
