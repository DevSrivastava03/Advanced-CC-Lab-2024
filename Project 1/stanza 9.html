            In stanza 9, Angelou sheds the "nights of terror," stepping into a hopeful "daybreak." <br>Leaving behind pain, she carries the "gifts" of her ancestors, not their burdens. <br>"I am the dream and the hope of the slave," she declares, embodying resilience and becoming a beacon for future generations. <br>This 100-word snapshot paints a picture of healing, progress, and the enduring power of hope, leaving a lasting echo of triumph.
