            The third stanza of "Still I Rise" builds on the theme of resilience by comparing the speaker's rise to natural phenomena.<br> 
            Just as "moons and like suns" inevitably rise and tides surge with unwavering "certainty," <br>
            her ascent is an unstoppable force. This simile emphasizes the naturalness and inevitability of her rise, <br>
            akin to the fundamental cycles of the universe. She declares, "Still I'll rise," <br>
            aligning her personal journey with the powerful rhythms of nature, suggesting an unstoppable and inherent strength within her. <br>
            This reinforces the message of the first two stanzas: no matter the external attempts to suppress her, her strength and determination,<br>
             like the tides, will find a way to rise and claim her rightful place.
