In the second stanza, Angelou shifts gears, directly questioning the "you" her oppressor. <br>
She asks, "Does my sassiness upset you?" Her confidence, termed "sassiness," challenges the established order. <br>
She observes their "gloom" when she thrives, suggesting their discomfort with her success. <br>
The "oil wells pumping in my living room" symbolize her abundance, contrasting their negativity.<br>
 This stanza flips the script instead of lamenting oppression, she proudly asserts her right to rise and prosper,<br>
  even if it makes them uncomfortable. <br>
  It's a bold declaration of self-worth and a challenge to societal norms that try to keep her down.
