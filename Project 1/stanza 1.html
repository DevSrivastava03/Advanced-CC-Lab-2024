        <h1>Meaning</h1>
        <p>
            In the opening stanza of "Still I Rise," Maya Angelou confronts oppression head-on.<br>
            Despite "twisted lies" and being "trod in the very dirt,"<br>
            she declares: "But still, like dust, I'll rise." This powerful metaphor paints a picture of resilience.<br>
            No matter how they try to write her out of history or push her down, her spirit, like dust motes catching the light, <br>
            will rise and overcome.<br>
            This opening sets the stage for the poem's enduring message: even in the face of hardship, hope and resistance prevail.
