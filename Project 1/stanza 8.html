            In stanza 8, Angelou trades defiance for introspection.<br>
             She rises "out of history's shame," acknowledging past pain but refusing to be held down.<br>
              The image of a "black ocean" symbolizes her vast inner strength, "welling and swelling" like an unstoppable tide.<br>
               This shift connects her personal journey to the power of nature, emphasizing her inherent strength and inevitable rise. <br>
               In 100 words, the eighth stanza becomes a declaration of self-awareness and power, rising above painful history like a majestic, unstoppable force.
