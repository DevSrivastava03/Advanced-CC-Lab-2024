In stanza 7, Angelou throws a mic drop on societal norms. <br>
"Does my sexiness upset you?" she asks, reclaiming femininity as power. <br>
"Diamonds at my thighs" symbolize inner wealth and defy struggle stereotypes. <br>
Finally, she "dances like I've got diamonds," celebrating her body and self with uninhibited joy. <br>
This 100-word burst ignites self-love, sensuality, and a triumphant dance of self-ownership.<br>
